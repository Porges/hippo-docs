# What languages can I use with Hippo? Why isn't my favorite language supported?

Hippo can serve any WebAssembly module that was compiled with support for [Web Application System Interface or WASI](/webassembly/#webassembly-system-interface-wasi).
Currently those languages are **AssemblyScript, C, Rust and Swift**.

Other languages such as C#, Python and JavaScript will hopefully support WASI in the future.
